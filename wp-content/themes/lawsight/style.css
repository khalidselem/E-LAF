Description: Debt collectors in Egypt were, in the beginning, lawyersâ€™ offices, and there were no collection companies specialized in collection work, as is the case in Europe and the United States. ELAF Collection Company is a leading debt collection company in Egypt for the benefit of international clients since 2000. We do not only cover Egypt, but we help local clients to collect and recover their money in any country around the world. We use our resources to evaluate your file and determine the best way to collect your debt in Egypt. We even search for the debtor in case the data is out of date.
